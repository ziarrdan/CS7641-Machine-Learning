To run the program please follow the following steps:

1. You can find the public GitHub repository and clone it using the following URL:

https://github.com/ziarrdan/CS7641-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Assignment%203

Note that this repo is going to be used for all the assignments for this course. This project can be found under the “Assignment 3” folder specifically.

2. The project was originally written in PyCharm and all the project files are already checked in, so you can directly open the directory as a PyCharm project and start setting the environment.

3. The code was written using the following libraries (the dependencies for each library is not mentioned as they are automatically installed):

matplotlib      3.2.0
numpy           1.18.1
panda           1.0.1
scikit-learn    0.22.2
scipy           1.4.1
seaborn		0.10.0

You can simply install the required libraries using pip and the requirements.txt file that is available in the repository. 

4. To run the project simply run the runscript.py file under the Assignment 3 directory in the repo. The figures are generated under its corresponding “Figures” folder and all the logs are generated in the console.
