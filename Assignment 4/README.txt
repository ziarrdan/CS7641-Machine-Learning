To run the program please follow the following steps:

1. You can find the public GitHub repository and clone it using the following URL:

https://github.com/ziarrdan/CS7641-Machine-Learning/tree/master/Assignment%204

Note that this repo is going to be used for all the assignments for this course. This project can be found under the “Assignment 4” folder specifically.

2. The project was originally written in PyCharm and all the project files are already checked in, so you can directly open the directory as a PyCharm project and start setting the environment. To be able to use the specific fork of the mdptoolbox library (mdptoolbox-hiive), a Conda environment was set up and used in PyCharm.

3. The code was written using the following libraries (the dependencies for each library is not mentioned as they are automatically installed):

mdptoolbox-hiive	4.0.3.1
gridworld-viz		0.0.0
matplotlib      	3.1.2
numpy           	1.18.1
panda           	0.25.3
scikit-learn    	0.22.1
scipy           	1.4.1

4. To run the project simply run the runscript.py file under the Assignment 4 directory in the repo. The figures are generated under its corresponding “Figures” folder.
